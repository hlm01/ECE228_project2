In our project we build upon the model [Attentive FP](https://github.com/OpenDrugAI/AttentiveFP)---specifically we build upon [the implementation by pytorch](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/attentive_fp.py) as the original has compatability issues with newer systems.

The code requires FIXME

You can run the code in FIXME.ipynb
